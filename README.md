# Variational Calculus

This is a repository with some old scripts that I writed to solve some variational calculus problems
at undergrad school, 2015. I hope to improve this repository with more interesting FEM problems...

At the moment, there are just some random problems without citations.

## Running

Besides q10, all you need is Octave. I tested this with version 9.2.0, but since I wrote a long time ago
(2011~2015), I should work with older versions.

Other dependency is pandoc, but one can ommit that if needed.

## To Do

- More Variational Calculus problems
- Add Wavelet problems & solutions
- Add some FEM problems & solutions with Octave
- Test BRLCAD scripts
- Test FreeCAD scripts for FEM problems
